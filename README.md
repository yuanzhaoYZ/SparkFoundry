### Introduction

Apache Spark is an open-source, distributed computing system that offers a fast and general-purpose cluster computing framework for big data processing. While the capabilities it offers are vast, often developers need quick and ready-to-use code snippets across different languages. SparkFoundry bridges this gap by providing a wide array of snippets ranging from basic data transformations to advanced machine learning implementations.
